# Andaluh-NET

In order to test the code please:

- Install the latest version of the .NET Core SDK https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1
- Download the code to a folder of your hard drive
- Open a console and go to the root folder of the project. I will call it `.\andaluh-net` from now on.
- There you can type `dotnet test` to see how the library performs (This is a bit slow as it tests 87000 cases).
- Alternatively you can go to `.\andalu-net\TestApp` and there type `dotnet run "Hola mundo"` and perform your own tests with your own text. You don't have to type only one word but don't forget the quotation marks!

Have fun!
